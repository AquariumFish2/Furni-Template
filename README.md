first of all this project was made first by untree.co,
and I used their public template to practice the design with no intention to make this project,
their copyright signature are at the footer of the website thanks alot for providing such material it helped so much,

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The page acts as a static template made with plain html&css with some js to make the image vieweres functional.
this project has 8 sites at total all full responsive.
some improvments will be added soon.
and more dynamic version will be in another repository soon.
